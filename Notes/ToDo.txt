To Do List:
==========

1) Implement Module/Modules Class

2) Token resource should only allow access via username and password
   and not via the token, as if the token gets compromised an attacker
   could just use the token to get another token and so on. (I feel this is
   the only security issue using this type of auth) That and it needs to be TLS secured.

3) Implement SSL: how to server via HTTPS: http://flask.pocoo.org/snippets/111/

4) When updating a resource e.g. engagement/1 we should have another db column so:

eng_name | eng_desc | eng_user_id (created by) | update_user_id (last updated by)

that way when we issue a PUT request to a resource to update it we can figure out what user updated it without
overwritting the created by user.
