To Do List:
==========

1) Implement Module/Modules Class

2) Token resource should only allow access via username and password
   and not via the token, as if the token gets compromised an attacker
   could just use the token to get another token and so on. (I feel this is
   the only security issue using this type of auth) That and it needs to be TLS secured.

3) Implement SSL: how to server via HTTPS: http://flask.pocoo.org/snippets/111/
